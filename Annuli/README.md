- `Preprocessing` contains code to remove artefacts from the dataset. Run this first or ask us for a cleaned version of the dataset.
- `DataGeneration` contains different approaches for generating the dataset, including training/validation/test sets. Consult the README there for more information.
- `NeuralNetwork` contains an implementation of a convolutional neural network for the annuli dataset.
- `Classifier`contains the classification code for unknown samples, it needs jpeg images, learnt weights to predict annulus region in the image.
- `Logs` contains logs with epoch by epoch training results for different experiments tried.
- `Docs` contains summary of experiments tried so far.
